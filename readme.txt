The easy price quote generator


== Description ==
What I Charge simplifies your life by allowing you to dynamically generate price quotes for the products and services you offer. Start with your base price then  include any additional features or addon options. Your client gets a running price total as options are selected. When they are finished an email is sent to you showing all of their choices. Spend more time working on what you love and less time dealing with clients.
